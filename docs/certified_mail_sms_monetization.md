## KPIs & Analytics
- Track Lead→Consult, Consult→Purchase, Average Order Value, LTV, Refund%, Time-to-Value.
- Monitor gross margin per channel, token breakage rate, churn, and activation (first mail send + SMS automation).
- Instrument events: `mail.credit_purchased`, `mail.sent`, `sms.sent`, `stripe.subscription.updated`, `nepq.stage_completed`.

## Metrics / A/B Test Ideas
1. Test CTA copy: “Send compliant disputes now” vs. “Launch certified dispute workflow”.
2. Compare pricing anchor order: Elite-first vs Starter-first to influence perceived value.
3. Bundle upsell timing: modal at letter generation vs post-payment confirmation.
4. Experiment bilingual toggle placement (header vs hero) for conversion impact.
5. Offer split test: free SMS credits vs free certified mail credit on trial signup.

2. Launch Stripe billing with metered overage and portal for self-serve upgrades.
3. Build certified mail automation wizard with bilingual UX + trust badges.
