## Post-Production
1. Trim dead air; add subtitle track for clarity.
2. Export MP4 (1080p) + GIF teaser (15s). Save to `docs/media/getting-started-demo.mp4` and `docs/media/getting-started-demo.gif`.
3. Upload to Loom/YouTube/Vimeo. Update README link with the public URL.
4. Embed CTA overlays for "Start Your Audit" and "Schedule Strategy Call" linking to your preferred scheduling tool.

## Analytics
- Track `demo_played`, `demo_50_percent`, `demo_completed` events in your analytics platform.
- Compare conversion lift for visitors who watch the demo vs those who skip using an A/B test (demo above the fold vs below fold).

## Next Steps
- Refresh the demo quarterly as features ship (see README change log).
- Ensure captions reinforce trust for all audiences.
- Repurpose the script into a 30-second ad and a 3-minute onboarding clip.
